Scisprint 2020 August: uTensor
==============================

uTensor is an extremely lightweight machine learning inference framework built
on TensorFlow and optimized for Arm targets. It consists of a runtime library
and an offline tool that handles most of the model translation work. This repo
holds the core runtime and some example implementations of operators, memory
managers/schedulers, and more, and the size of the core runtime is only ~2KB!

The project repository is at https://utensor.ai/. We cordially invite everyone
who’s interested in machine learning and edge computing to join us hacking
uTensor.
